/**
 * (Physics: finding runway length) Given an airplaneâ€™s acceleration a and take-off 
 * speed v, you can compute the minimum runway length needed for an airplane to 
 * take off using the following formula:
 *                v^2
 *      length = ----
 *                2a
 * Write a program that prompts the user to enter v in meters/second (m/s) and the 
 * acceleration a in meters/second squared (m/s2), and displays the minimum runway length.
