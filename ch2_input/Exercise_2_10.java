/**
 * (Science: calculating energy) Write a program that calculates the energy needed 
 * to heat water from an initial temperature to a final temperature. Your program 
 * should prompt the user to enter the amount of water in kilograms and the initial 
 * and final temperatures of the water. The formula to compute the energy is
 *      Q = M * (finalTemperature â€“ initialTemperature) * 4184
 * where M is the weight of water in kilograms, temperatures are in degrees Celsius, 
 * and energy Q is measured in joules.
