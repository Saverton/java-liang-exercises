/**
 * (Simulation: coupon collectorâ€™s problem) Coupon collector is a classic statistics 
 * problem with many practical applications. The problem is to pick objects from 
 * a set of objects repeatedly and find out how many picks are needed for all the
 * objects to be picked at least once. A variation of the problem is to pick cards from 
 * a shuffled deck of 52 cards repeatedly and find out how many picks are needed 
 * before you see one of each suit. Assume a picked card is placed back in the deck 
 * before picking another. Write a program to simulate the number of picks needed 
 * to get four cards from each suit and display the four cards picked (it is possible a 
 * card may be picked twice).
