/**
 * (Algebra: solve 2 * 2 linear equations) You can use Cramerâ€™s rule to solve the following 2 * 2 system of linear equation:
 * 
 * ax + by = e      ed - bf         af - ec
 *              x = -------     y = -------
 * cx + dy = f      ad - bc         ad - bc
 * 
 * Write a program that solves the following equation and displays the value for x and y:
 *     3.4x + 50.2y = 44.5
 *     2.1x + .55y = 5.9
